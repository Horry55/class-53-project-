                    A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Until the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although reed, bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, the birch bark canoe, the animal hide-covered kayak[19] and coracle and the dugout canoe made from a single log.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>  
                  A boat is designed to float on water, and can be used for travel, recreation, sports, fishing, transportation, military use and for rescue operations.
                </li>
